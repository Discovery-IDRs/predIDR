# Data Management

This is an overview of the file management strategy for this project.  The purpose is to have an organized system in place to both organize your work as it happens as well as to make it approachable to other current and future team members.

Each project is different and evolves over time and accordingly requires unique and flexible management standards. Thus, consider this a "living document" that is open to ongoing revision.
